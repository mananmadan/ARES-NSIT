In the scaling operation
>First, we declare a variable for storing the input image
>Then image is loaded which is stored in the same folder as of the solution of the project
>Then resize command is used
>it uses 6 attributes
>input image,output image (which is displayed after resizing)
>fx,fy are the factors which are multiplied to the length of the input image to give the dimension of the resized image
>interpolation generally used are INTER_AREA,INTER_CUBIC,INTER_LINEAR
>INTER_AREA is generally used when we have to shrink the image
>INTER_CUBIC,INTER_LINEAR is generally used when the image is to be expanded
>INTER_CUBIC is slower than INTER_LINEAR interpolation


THINGS LEARNT
